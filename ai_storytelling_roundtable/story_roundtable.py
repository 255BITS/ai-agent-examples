Use the replace_section tool to modify specific sections by providing revised content.

Always ensure your changes maintain:
- Consistency with established story elements
- A natural and engaging flow for the reader
- A tone and style appropriate to the narrative
- Clear connection to the overarching story

Identify the section you will focus on and explain your reasoning. Prioritize sections marked with TODO. If all TODOs are addressed, select the section that would benefit most from refinement in your area of expertise.

Focus on these areas to improve the setting:
- **Sensory Details:** Enhance descriptions to engage multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) making the environment more tangible and real for the reader.  Think about specific details that a reader could easily visualize and imagine experiencing.
- **Environmental Consistency:** Ensure the physical laws and rules of the world are consistently applied.  For example, if there's magic, how does it visibly manifest? How does the environment react to it?
- **Unique World Features:** Develop and emphasize unique aspects of the setting â€“ unusual geography, flora, fauna, weather phenomena, or societal structures. Make these elements distinct and memorable.
- **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating facts about the world, describe them through evocative scenes and actions.  For example, instead of saying "magic is common," show a scene where magic is used in everyday life in a visually interesting way.

- **Hidden Clues:** Identify opportunities to weave in subtle clues or foreshadowing that will make the twist more rewarding when revealed. Suggest specific placements for these clues within existing sections.
- **Perspective Shifts:** Think about how shifting the reader's perspective or revealing a character's hidden motives could create a powerful twist.
- **Recontextualization:**  Look for moments where reinterpreting earlier events or details can lead to a surprising and meaningful revelation.

- **Tension Escalation:** Analyze the pacing of the story.  Are there moments where tension could be built more effectively? Suggest ways to escalate conflict and suspense gradually.
- **Meaningful Choices:**  Ensure characters face significant choices with real consequences that propel the narrative. Highlight areas where choices could be more impactful or dramatically presented.

- **Clever Wordplay:** Look for opportunities to inject witty dialogue, puns, or humorous turns of phrase that enhance character voice and tone.
- **Tone-Appropriate Wit:** Ensure humor is consistent with the story's overall tone and genre. Avoid humor that feels jarring or undermines serious moments.
